The Hotel Management System is a user-friendly desktop application designed to streamline and automate the core operations of a hotel or lodging facility. Built using Java Swing and connected to a MySQL database, the system provides hotel staff and administrators with efficient tools to manage rooms, handle customer check-ins/check-outs, track booking history, and maintain employee and user records.


üß© Key Features:


üè® Room Management: Add, Edit, and Delete room data with live status tracking (Available, Not Available, Occupied).

üîÅ Customer Check-In & Check-Out: Smooth guest management using date pickers, room-type filtering, and auto-calculated pricing.

üìñ Booking History: View and search historical data for past check-ins/check-outs.

üìà User & Manager Dashboard: Manage accounts, access rights, and staff details securely.

üìà Admin Dashboard: Intuitive navigation through different panels using CardLayout and custom background design.



This system is tailored for both front-desk operations and hotel administrators, helping reduce manual errors, enhance data accuracy, and improve service quality.
